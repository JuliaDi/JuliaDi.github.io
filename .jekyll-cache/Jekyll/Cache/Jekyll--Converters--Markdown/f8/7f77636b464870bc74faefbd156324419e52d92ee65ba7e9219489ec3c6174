I"ý<p>Hello world! this is my first Jekyll blog post. I hope you like it.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Iâ€™ve been thinking about building a personal website for the better part of the last two years, and have simply put it on the backburner. This site previously was little more than a landing page that I had scraped together for the admissions process into graduate school / Ph.D. programs (yes, a blog post about that will be coming!).</p>

<p>I hope to write more often (limited by my willingness to type into a computer terminal for hours on end), not to reach anyone in particular, but as an exercise in self-reflection. Maybe one day Iâ€™ll even write something useful or worth reading. For now though, youâ€™ll just see the ramblings of an art-deprived engineer.</p>
