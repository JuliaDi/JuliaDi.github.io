<p><strong>Abstract.</strong>
Spyndra is our newest open-source quadruped robot platform. It has eight motors, an IMU, and runs Raspberry-PI 3. It requires non-intuitive motor commands in order to locomote, and thus provides an interesting challenge for gait learning algorithms, such as those frequently developed in the Evolutionary Computation and Artificial Life communities.
<br />
This open-source robot is composed of off-the-shelf motors and 3D-printed parts, enabling anyone to construct this robot for roughly $600 in parts plus printing material. We hope other hobbyists and other research teams will modify its design according to their scientific needs.

<p><strong>(A)</strong> Graph of all units and the connections between them; the dashed circles represent (equally-sized) clusters. <br />
<strong>(B)</strong> Assigning clusters to treatment arms: completely randomized (CR) and cluster-based randomized assignment (CBR). <br />
<strong>(C)</strong> Assigning units to treatment buckets—treatment and control—using the corresponding strategy. <br />
<strong>(D)</strong> Computing the treatment effect within each treatment arm: \(\hat \mu_{cr}\) and \(\hat \mu_{cbr}\), and variance: \(\hat \sigma^2_{cr}\) and \(\hat \sigma^2_{cbr}\). <br />
<strong>(E)</strong> Computing the difference of the estimates from each treatment arm: \(\Delta = \hat \mu_{cr} - \hat \mu_{cbr}\), and the total variance: \(\hat \sigma^2 = \hat \sigma^2_{cr} + \hat \sigma^2_{cbr}\). <br /></p>
