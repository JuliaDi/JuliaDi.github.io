**Abstract.**
Spyndra is our newest open-source quadruped robot platform. It has eight motors, an IMU, and runs Raspberry-PI 3. It requires non-intuitive motor commands in order to locomote, and thus provides an interesting challenge for gait learning algorithms, such as those frequently developed in the Evolutionary Computation and Artificial Life communities.
<br/>
This open-source robot is composed of off-the-shelf motors and 3D-printed parts, enabling anyone to construct this robot for roughly $600 in parts plus printing material. We hope other hobbyists and other research teams will modify its design according to their scientific needs.

**(A)** Graph of all units and the connections between them; the dashed circles represent (equally-sized) clusters. <br/>
**(B)** Assigning clusters to treatment arms: completely randomized (CR) and cluster-based randomized assignment (CBR). <br/>
**(C)** Assigning units to treatment buckets---treatment and control---using the corresponding strategy. <br/>
**(D)** Computing the treatment effect within each treatment arm: $$\hat \mu_{cr}$$ and $$\hat \mu_{cbr}$$, and variance: $$\hat \sigma^2_{cr}$$ and $$\hat \sigma^2_{cbr}$$. <br/>
**(E)** Computing the difference of the estimates from each treatment arm: $$\Delta = \hat \mu_{cr} - \hat \mu_{cbr}$$, and the total variance: $$\hat \sigma^2 = \hat \sigma^2_{cr} + \hat \sigma^2_{cbr}$$. <br/>
